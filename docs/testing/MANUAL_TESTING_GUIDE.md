# WhisperEngine Manual Testing Guide
## Comprehensive AI Systems Validation

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Purpose**: Manual validation of 4-phase AI architecture in Discord DMs

## üéØ **Testing Overview**

This manual test plan validates WhisperEngine's sophisticated AI systems through real Discord DM conversations. Each test sequence is designed to trigger specific AI phases and demonstrate the integration of global facts, emotional intelligence, memory networks, and human-like conversation optimization.

## üìã **Global Data Flow Summary**

Before testing, understand how global data reaches the LLM:

### **Global Facts Collection**
1. **Source**: User messages are analyzed by `GlobalFactExtractor` using LLM
2. **Storage**: Facts stored in ChromaDB `global_facts` collection with metadata
3. **Categories**: World knowledge, relationships, bot capabilities, general information
4. **Retrieval**: `retrieve_relevant_global_facts()` queries based on conversation context
5. **Integration**: Global facts get **priority placement** in LLM prompts as system context

### **Prompt Integration Path**
```
User Message ‚Üí Memory Retrieval (includes global facts) ‚Üí Context Building ‚Üí System Prompt Enhancement ‚Üí LLM
```

**Example Global Fact in Prompt**:
```
Global Facts (about the world, relationships, and the bot):
- Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum
- Machine learning requires large datasets for training
- Discord bots can respond to mentions and direct messages
```

## üß™ **Test Execution Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- WhisperEngine bot running in development mode
- Access to Discord DM with the bot
- Bot has proper permissions and is online
- Environment variables configured (especially `ENABLE_GLOBAL_FACTS=true`)

### **Test Session Preparation**
1. Start fresh DM conversation with bot
2. Wait for bot's initial response to confirm connection
3. Note timestamp to track memory persistence across tests
4. Be prepared to wait 15+ seconds between messages for full AI processing

- Verify emotional context in system prompts
- Look for appropriate mood detection in responses

### **If Memory Seems Inconsistent:**
- Check ChromaDB persistence configuration
- Verify conversation cache is working
- Ensure Redis connection for session management

### **If Responses Seem Non-Human:**
- Check Phase 4 integration configuration
- Verify system prompt enhancements are active
- Look for conversation mode detection
