# Follow-Up Message System - Design Document

## üéØ System Overview

An integrated background job system that proactively engages users who haven't messaged in a while, running within the main Discord bot process and using the existing PostgreSQL database infrastructure.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

### Integrated Components

1. **Generic Job Scheduler** (Integrated in Main Bot Process)
   - Handles multiple job types including follow-up messages
   - Uses existing PostgreSQL connection pool
   - Runs background tasks within bot process
   - Supports retry logic and error handling

2. **Follow-Up Job Handler** (Part of Job Scheduler)
   - Monitors user activity from PostgreSQL
   - Generates personalized follow-up messages using existing LLM
   - Integrates with existing emotion/relationship systems
   - Respects user preferences and privacy settings

3. **Message Queue** (Optional Redis - Already Available)
   - Can queue messages if Redis is available
   - Handles rate limiting and cooldowns
   - Falls back to direct PostgreSQL storage

4. **Discord Integration** (Existing Bot)
   - Sends follow-up messages via existing bot instance
   - Maintains conversation continuity
   - Uses existing personality/memory systems
   - Direct access to Discord API without webhooks

## üìä Database Schema Extensions

### Job Scheduler Tables (Automatically Created)

```sql
-- Generic job scheduling system
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS scheduled_jobs (
    job_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    job_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    scheduled_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    started_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    error_message TEXT,
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    max_retries INTEGER DEFAULT 3
);

-- Job execution history for analytics
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS job_execution_history (
    execution_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    job_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    execution_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    duration_ms INTEGER,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    error_message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Follow-Up Specific Tables

```sql
-- Follow-up message tracking and history
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS follow_up_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    message_sent TEXT NOT NULL,
    context_data JSONB,
    sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    response_received BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    response_time TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Enhanced user profiles with follow-up preferences
ALTER TABLE user_profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS follow_ups_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_follow_up_sent TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS follow_up_frequency_hours INTEGER DEFAULT 48;
```

### Performance Indexes
```sql
-- Indexes for optimal performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_scheduled_jobs_time_status 
ON scheduled_jobs(scheduled_time, status);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_scheduled_jobs_type 
ON scheduled_jobs(job_type);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_follow_up_user_time 
ON follow_up_history(user_id, sent_at);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_job_history_time 
ON job_execution_history(execution_time);
```

## üîß System Implementation

### Integrated Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ job_scheduler.py       # Generic job scheduling system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jobs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ follow_up_handler.py   # Follow-up message logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cleanup_handler.py     # Data cleanup jobs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run.py                     # Bot with integrated scheduler
```

### Key Features

#### 1. **Automatic Integration**
```python
# Job scheduler starts with bot
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    if job_scheduler:
        await job_scheduler.start()
        
        # Set bot instance for handlers
        for handler in job_scheduler.job_handlers.values():
            if hasattr(handler, 'set_bot'):
                handler.set_bot(bot)
```

#### 2. **Smart Follow-up Scheduling**
```python
# Automatically schedule when users become inactive
async def schedule_follow_up_message(user_id: str, delay_hours: int = 48):
    """Schedule personalized follow-up based on user context"""
    # Uses existing conversation history and emotional context
    # Respects user preferences and cooldown periods
    # Generates natural, personalized messages
```

#### 3. **Intelligent Messaging**
```python
# Generate personalized follow-up messages
async def _generate_follow_up_message(user_id: str, context: Dict) -> str:
    """Uses existing user context for personalization"""
    # Access to:
    # - User's conversation history (PostgreSQL)
    # - Emotional profile and relationship level
    # - Recent topics and interests
    # - Previous interaction patterns
```

## üîÑ Integration Benefits

### Shared Resources
- **Database Connections**: Uses existing PostgreSQL pool
- **Memory Systems**: Direct access to conversation history and user profiles
- **LLM Client**: Uses same AI service for personalized message generation
- **Discord Bot**: Direct API access without webhooks

## ü§ñ Message Types & Examples

### 1. **Relationship-Based Follow-ups**

**Acquaintance Level**:
- "Hey [name]! Just wanted to check in and see how things are going. üòä"
- "Hi there! Hope you're having a good week. Anything interesting happening lately?"

**Friend Level**:
- "Hey [name]! I was thinking about our conversation regarding [last_topic]. How did that work out?"
- "Hope you're doing well! I remembered you were dealing with [emotional_context] - feeling any better?"

**Close Friend Level**:
- "Hey [name] ‚ù§Ô∏è I miss our chats! How are you holding up with everything?"
- "Thinking of you! I know [time_period] ago you were [emotional_context]. Hope things are looking up!"

### 2. **Emotion-Driven Follow-ups**

**After Stress/Sadness**:
- "Hey [name], I wanted to check in on you. I remember you were going through a tough time. How are you feeling now?"

**After Happiness/Excitement**:
- "Hi [name]! I remember you were excited about [topic]. How did it go?"

### 3. **Interest-Based Follow-ups**

Based on previous conversation topics:
- "Hey [name]! I remember you mentioned [interest/hobby]. Have you been able to work on that lately?"

## üìà Success Metrics & Analytics

### Built-in Tracking
The job scheduler automatically tracks:
- **Job Execution Times**: Performance monitoring
- **Success/Failure Rates**: System reliability
- **Response Rates**: User engagement effectiveness
- **Retry Patterns**: System optimization insights

### Follow-up Specific Metrics
```sql
-- Response rate tracking
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_sent,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE response_received = true) as responses,
    (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE response_received = true)::float / COUNT(*)) * 100 as response_rate
FROM follow_up_history 
WHERE sent_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Engagement by user
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as follow_ups_sent,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE response_received = true) as responses,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM response_time - sent_at) / 60) as avg_response_minutes
FROM follow_up_history 
GROUP BY user_id;
```

### Optimization Insights
- **Optimal Timing**: When users are most likely to respond
- **Message Effectiveness**: Which personalization works best
- **Frequency Analysis**: Ideal intervals between follow-ups
- **User Patterns**: Individual engagement preferences

## üîí Privacy & Safety

### Automatic Privacy Integration
- **Existing Privacy Controls**: Inherits all current privacy protections
- **User Consent**: Opt-in/opt-out via simple commands
- **Data Boundaries**: Uses same privacy manager for context boundaries
- **Audit Trail**: All follow-up activity logged and trackable

### Safety Measures
- **Rate Limiting**: Built into job scheduler (max retries, cooldowns)
- **User Interaction Checks**: Avoids messaging recently active users
- **Respect Preferences**: Honors user's follow-up settings
- **Emotional Sensitivity**: Integrates with existing emotion tracking
- **Admin Override**: Complete administrative control over all jobs

## üöÄ Implementation & Deployment

### Current Status: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
The integrated job scheduler system is already implemented and ready to use:

1. **Job Scheduler**: `src/utils/job_scheduler.py` - Generic job system
2. **Follow-up Handler**: `src/jobs/follow_up_handler.py` - Follow-up logic  
3. **Main Integration**: Job scheduler starts with bot in `src/main.py`
4. **Commands**: User and admin commands already available
5. **Database Schema**: Auto-created on first run

### Quick Start
```bash
