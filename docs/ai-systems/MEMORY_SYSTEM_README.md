# Discord Bot Memory System - ChromaDB Integration

## 🚀 Successfully Applied Changes!

Your Discord bot now has a comprehensive user-scoped memory system powered by ChromaDB! Here's what was added:

## 📁 New Files Created:
- `memory_manager.py` - ChromaDB-based memory management system
- Updated `requirements.txt` with new dependencies

## 🔧 Dependencies Installed:
- `chromadb>=0.4.0` - Vector database for storing memories
- `sentence-transformers>=2.2.0` - AI embeddings for semantic search

## 🤖 New Bot Features:

### **Memory Management Commands:**
- `!add_fact <fact>` - Manually add facts about yourself
- `!list_facts` - View all stored facts about you  
- `!remove_fact <search>` - Search and remove facts (direct removal)
- `!remove_fact_by_number <num> <search>` - Remove a specific fact by number
- `!my_memory` - Comprehensive overview of what bot remembers
- `!forget_me` - Delete all your data (with confirmation)

### **🤖 Automatic Fact Discovery:**
- `!auto_facts [on/off]` - Toggle automatic fact extraction from conversations
- `!auto_extracted_facts` - View facts automatically discovered from your messages
- `!extract_facts <message>` - Test fact extraction on any message

### **Sync & Debug Commands:**
- `!sync_check` - Check if DM conversations are properly stored (DM only)
- `!import_history [limit]` - Import older DM history into memory (DM only)
- `!memory_stats` - View memory system statistics (admin only)

## 🧠 How It Works:

### **Automatic Memory:**
- All conversations are automatically stored in ChromaDB
- **NEW: Automatic fact extraction** - The bot now intelligently identifies and stores facts about users from natural conversation
- Semantic search finds relevant past conversations
- User-scoped - each user's data is separate and private

### **🤖 Intelligent Fact Discovery:**
- **Pattern Recognition:** Detects personal information like preferences, location, occupation, pets, etc.
- **Confidence Scoring:** Each auto-extracted fact has a confidence score (60%+ threshold for storage)
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Automatically avoids storing similar facts multiple times
- **User Control:** Users can enable/disable automatic extraction at any time

### **Smart Context:**
- Recent Discord messages (5-10) for immediate context
- Relevant memories from ChromaDB for long-term context
- No need to pull full Discord history every time

### **Data Privacy:**
- Each user controls their own data
- `!forget_me` allows complete data deletion
- User facts are stored separately from conversations

## 🏗️ Architecture:

```
Discord Message → Memory Manager → ChromaDB
                ↗         ↓         ↘
    Recent Context   Fact Extractor  Semantic Search
                ↘         ↓         ↗
                  LLM Context
```

**NEW: Fact Extraction Pipeline:**
```
User Message → Fact Extractor → Pattern Matching → Confidence Scoring → Auto-Storage
```

## 📊 Storage:
- ChromaDB data stored in `./chromadb_data/` directory
- Persistent across bot restarts
- Vector embeddings enable semantic search
- Metadata includes timestamps, user IDs, message types, **confidence scores**
- **Auto-extracted facts** are marked with extraction method and confidence

## 🎯 Next Steps:
1. Set your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable
2. Start the bot with `python basic_discord_bot.py`
3. Test memory commands in DMs
4. **Try `!auto_facts on` to enable automatic fact discovery**
5. Use `!import_history` to sync existing conversations

## 🔍 Key Benefits:
- **Persistent Memory** - Survives bot restarts
- **Semantic Search** - Finds relevant context intelligently  
- **User Control** - Full data transparency and deletion
- **Scalable** - Efficient memory usage
- **Privacy-First** - User-scoped data isolation

The bot now remembers conversations and can provide much more contextual, personalized responses! 🎉
