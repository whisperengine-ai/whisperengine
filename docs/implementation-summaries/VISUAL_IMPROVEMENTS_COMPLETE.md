# 🎨 WhisperEngine Visual Improvements - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Settings Dialog Visibility Fixed
**Problem:** White text on light background made settings unreadable
**Solution:** Comprehensive theme-aware styling system

#### What Was Fixed:
- **Theme Detection:** Added automatic light/dark theme detection
- **Dynamic Colors:** Background, text, and border colors adapt to theme
- **Platform Styling:** macOS, Windows, and Linux specific enhancements
- **Complete Coverage:** All UI elements now have proper contrast

#### Technical Implementation:
```python
# Theme-aware color system
if is_dark_theme:
    bg_color = "#2b2b2b"
    text_color = "#ffffff"
    border_color = "#555555"
else:
    bg_color = "#f0f0f0"
    text_color = "#000000"
    border_color = "#cccccc"
```

### 2. ✅ WhisperEngine Logo Integration
**Request:** Add whisper-engine.jpeg as small logo in upper left
**Solution:** Multi-location logo integration with fallback support

#### Logo Placement:
- **Header Logo:** 32x32 scaled logo in main window header
- **Window Icon:** Application window icon
- **System Tray:** 16x16 scaled logo in system tray
- **Fallback:** Robot emoji if logo fails to load

#### Technical Implementation:
```python
def load_logo(self) -> Optional[QPixmap]:
    """Load the WhisperEngine logo with intelligent scaling"""
    logo_path = project_root / "img" / "whisper-engine.jpeg"
    if logo_path.exists():
        pixmap = QPixmap(str(logo_path))
        return pixmap.scaled(32, 32, Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio)
    return None
```

        theme = ui_config.theme
        
        # Automatic theme detection
        is_dark_theme = theme == "dark" or (theme == "auto" and self.is_system_dark_theme())

        # Header logo (32x32)
        header_logo = QLabel()
        header_logo.setPixmap(self.load_logo())
