üß† WHY MULTI-DIMENSIONAL VECTORS?
================================
WhisperEngine uses 6-dimensional named vectors instead of single embeddings to capture
the full complexity of human conversation:

üìä SINGLE VECTOR LIMITATION (what most AI systems do):
   [0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.8, ...] - 384 numbers representing "something about this message"
   
‚ú® 6D NAMED VECTORS (WhisperEngine's approach):
   {
     "content": [0.1, 0.3, 0.2, ...],    // WHAT is being said (semantic meaning)
     "emotion": [0.8, 0.1, 0.7, ...],    // HOW the user feels (emotional context)  
     "semantic": [0.4, 0.6, 0.1, ...],   // KEY concepts and topics (clustering)
     "relationship": [0.2, 0.9, 0.3, ...], // WHO they are to us (bond development)
     "context": [0.7, 0.2, 0.8, ...],    // WHERE/WHEN this happens (situational)
     "personality": [0.3, 0.4, 0.9, ...]  // CHARACTER alignment (bot personality fit)
   }

This allows WhisperEngine to search for:
- Similar EMOTIONS even if topics differ ("I'm excited about..." vs "I'm thrilled about...")
- Similar RELATIONSHIPS ("opening up" vs "sharing personal details") 
- Similar CONTEXTS ("work stress" vs "job pressure")
- Similar PERSONALITIES ("analytical thinking" vs "systematic approach")
