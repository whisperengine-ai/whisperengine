# DEPRECATED: This file is being replaced by a multi-tier dependency system
# Please use the new structure for clean cross-platform support:
#
# Core dependencies (shared):     requirements-core.txt
# Platform optimizations:        requirements-platform.txt  
# Discord bot specific:          discord-bot/requirements-discord.txt
# Desktop app specific:          desktop-app/requirements-desktop.txt
#
# Installation:
#   Discord Bot: ./scripts/install-discord.sh (or .bat for Windows)
#   Desktop App: ./scripts/install-desktop.sh (or .bat for Windows)
#
# See DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md for full migration guide
#
# This file maintained for backward compatibility until migration complete

# Minimal compatibility installation - use new structure instead
discord.py==2.6.3
python-dotenv==1.1.1
chromadb
transformers>=4.30.0
requests==2.32.5
aiohttp==3.12.15

# For new installations, use:
# pip install -r requirements-core.txt
# pip install -r requirements-platform.txt
# pip install -r discord-bot/requirements-discord.txt  # For Discord bot
# OR
# pip install -r desktop-app/requirements-desktop.txt  # For desktop app
