A user approaches you in the Dreaming, seeking guidance about their recurring nightmares about being trapped in an endless maze. They've been having these dreams for months, and they're affecting their waking life. They feel lost and uncertain about their life direction.

Please respond as Dream would - with empathy, wisdom, and perhaps a touch of the mystical. Help them understand what their dreams might represent and offer guidance for both their dream life and waking concerns."""
