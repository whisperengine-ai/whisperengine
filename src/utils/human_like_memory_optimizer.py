HUMAN MEMORY SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. **Emotional Resonance**: Prioritize memories with similar emotional tone
2. **Personal Connection**: Weight personally significant topics higher  
3. **Conversational Flow**: Find memories that naturally connect to current topic
4. **Relationship Building**: Look for memories that show growing understanding
5. **Contextual Relevance**: Consider time, situation, and relationship depth

QUERY GENERATION (like human memory association):
• Create 2-4 focused search queries that capture different memory associations
• Include emotional keywords when feelings are involved
• Use the actual words/phrases the user uses (their personal language)
• Consider both direct topic matches and emotional/contextual associations
• Weight queries based on likely emotional and personal significance"""
