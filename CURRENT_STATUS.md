# Current Work Status - September 14, 2025

## What's Working ✅
- **Docker Compose System**: Production-ready multi-container setup with PostgreSQL, Redis, ChromaDB
- **Universal Chat Platform**: Architecture complete in `src/platforms/universal_chat.py`
- **Adaptive Configuration**: Environment detection and optimization in `src/config/adaptive_config.py`
- **Database Abstraction**: SQLite/PostgreSQL switching in `src/database/abstract_database.py`
- **FastAPI Web UI**: Professional ChatGPT-like interface with WebSocket communication
- **System Tray Integration**: Native desktop integration that gracefully degrades

## What's Broken ❌
- **Desktop App Build System**: PyInstaller integration has syntax errors and instability
- **Signal Handling**: Ctrl+C doesn't properly shutdown packaged desktop apps
- **Build Command**: `python build.py native_desktop --sqlite --debug` fails with errors
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Many completion claims were aspirational, not actual status

## Next Steps (Immediate Priority)
1. **Fix Desktop Build System** (`src/packaging/unified_builder.py`)
   - Address PyInstaller syntax errors and integration issues
   - Repair signal handling for proper Ctrl+C shutdown
   - Test macOS `.app` bundle creation and distribution

2. **Validate Docker System** (`docker-compose.yml`)
   - Run end-to-end testing to confirm production readiness
   - Document actual functionality vs claimed capabilities

3. **Create Status Documentation**
   - Maintain honest assessment of what works vs needs work
   - Leave breadcrumbs for future development sessions

## Context Notes
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/unified-scaling-architecture` (not main branch)
- **Branch Purpose**: Adding unified scaling and universal platform abstractions to existing Discord bot
- **Base System**: Discord bot with sophisticated AI memory and emotional intelligence
- **Branch Additions**: Desktop app entry point, universal chat platform, adaptive config, database abstraction
- **2-Tier Vision**: Extend Discord bot to support both Docker deployment + Native Desktop Apps
- **Real Completion Status**: Desktop app additions are ~1% complete, core Discord bot functionality exists
- **Performance Goal**: Native apps offer direct GPU access without Docker overhead

## Architecture Decisions Made
- **Universal Platform Abstraction**: Same AI conversation engine across deployment modes
- **Adaptive Storage**: SQLite for desktop, PostgreSQL for Docker with seamless switching
- **Environment Detection**: Auto-optimization based on hardware and deployment context
- **Documentation First**: Emphasize creating MD files for decisions and status tracking

## Documentation Cleanup Completed
- **Strategy Change**: Moved stale docs to `archive/stale-documentation-sept-2025` branch instead of local archive
- **Benefits**: Zero chance of stale docs polluting context in main development branches
- **Archived Branch Contains**:
  - `RELEASE_READINESS_REPORT.md` (overly optimistic release claims)
  - `SCALING_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` (overstated implementation)
  - `NATIVE_APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` (detailed plans for broken build system)
  - `PHASE4_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (claimed working features)
  - `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` (claimed "Phase 1-4 AI Systems: Fully implemented")
  - Comprehensive `ARCHIVE_README.md` explaining why docs were archived

## Files Modified This Session
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Updated with honest status and documentation requirements
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Created breadcrumb file for context preservation
- Created archive branch: `archive/stale-documentation-sept-2025`
- Removed misleading docs from main development branch entirely

## Known Working Components
- `desktop_app.py` - Desktop entry point (source works, packaging broken)
- `src/platforms/universal_chat.py` - Cross-platform chat abstraction
- `src/ui/web_ui.py` - FastAPI web interface with templates
- `src/config/adaptive_config.py` - Environment-aware configuration
- `src/database/database_integration.py` - Database abstraction layer

## Build System Issues
- `src/packaging/unified_builder.py` - Framework exists but PyInstaller integration broken
- `build.py` - Build script has syntax errors and stability problems
- Signal handling fixes applied to source but rebuild needed due to build system issues
