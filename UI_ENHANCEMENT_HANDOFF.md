## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **If Desktop App Won't Start**:
1. Check Python virtual environment is activated
2. Verify all dependencies installed: `pip list | grep -E "fastapi|uvicorn"`
3. Check port 8080 is not in use: `lsof -i :8080`
4. Try different port: Edit `desktop_app.py` line with `port = 8080`

### **If UI Features Don't Work**:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
2. Verify files were saved correctly (check file timestamps)
3. Clear browser cache and reload page
4. Test in different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### **If Copy Button Doesn't Work**:
- Check browser supports Clipboard API (modern browsers only)
- Test HTTPS vs HTTP (some features require HTTPS)
- Verify no JavaScript errors in console

### **If File Upload Doesn't Work**:
- Check file size is under 10MB limit
- Verify file type is supported (images, text, PDF, docs)
- Check browser supports File API and drag-drop
